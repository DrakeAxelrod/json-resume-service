Serverless service that uses the [jsonresume.org](https://jsonresume.org/) schema to generate dynamic resumes from a github gist that you can download or recieve back as a http response.

We use puppeteer with a headless chromium to essentially render an HTML page and convert to a pdf.

## What is a json resume?

## Why use this service?

Because it allows you to provide resumes in various styles as a service. This means that you define one data file (a resume.json) and you upload it as a public gist to github. Then you can provide that information to this service which whill dynamically generate resumes according to compliant formatters. This means that you can create professional looking resumes within seconds after defining your json resume.
