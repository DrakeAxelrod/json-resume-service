## ðŸ”¥ Refactors + Secret Gists

#### Secret Gist

> [!Tip]
> For private secret gists
>
> - [localhost:3000/gist/<gist_id>](http://localhost:3000/gist/<gist_id>)
> the first json file from that secret gist will be attempted
> the file can be named anything `my-private.json`
>
> eg: [localhost:3000/gist/6776c2096963f1ca8ddb1817c8674b93](http://localhost:3000/gist/6776c2096963f1ca8ddb1817c8674b93)
> eg: [https://jsonresume-service.vercel.app/gist/6776c2096963f1ca8ddb1817c8674b93](https://jsonresume-service.vercel.app/gist/6776c2096963f1ca8ddb1817c8674b93)

#### Public Gist

> [!Tip]
> For public gist `resume.json`
>
> - [localhost:3000/user/<username>](http://localhost:3000/<username>)
> the user must have a public gist named `resume.json`
>
> eg: [http://localhost:3000/user/drakeaxelrod](http://localhost:3000/user/drakeaxelrod)
> eg: [https://jsonresume-service.vercel.app/user/drakeaxelrod](https://jsonresume-service.vercel.app/user/drakeaxelrod)

Serverless service that uses the [jsonresume.org](https://jsonresume.org/) schema to generate dynamic resumes from a github gist that you can download or recieve back as a http response.

We use puppeteer with a headless chromium to essentially render an HTML page and convert to a pdf.

## What is a json resume?

Have you spent countless hours making a resume only to end up having to redo it with you want to change the format? what json resume does is allow for you to input your data in one place and then dynamically generate your resume with different templates you can learn more about this at their website [what is a json resume](https://jsonresume.org/getting-started/)

## Why use this service?

Because it allows you to provide resumes in various styles as a service.
This means that you define one data file (a resume.json) and you upload it as a public gist to github.

> [!Tip]
> use **secret gists**
>
> - the filename can be anything
> - the first json file will be attempted

Then you can provide that information to this service which will dynamically generate resumes according to compliant formatters.
This means that you can create professional looking resumes within seconds after defining your json resume.
